    <h2 class="ideal_job"> Job Title: Senior Network Engineer </h2>
    <!-- ideal job description body -->
    <p>
      My ideal job is to work as a Senior Network Engineer. The duties include evaluating the requirements for the network system. Afterwards, outlining what needs to be done such as devices required, location and implementation steps.  This is inclusive of preparations for the configurations needed for each network devices as well. Once design is confirmed, a Senior Network Engineer will be actively involved in the actual setup of the network system such as the hardware and device configurations to ensure that all is according to the blueprint.  Once the project has been completed, maintenance is then provided by continuous monitoring and if an issue arises, requires troubleshooting to resolve the issues using various tools available in the company. Aside from troubleshooting, prevention methods are also key which to be explored by the engineer as a mean to prevent future issues from emerging and to ensure the security of the network environment.
    </p>
    <h2 class="ideal_job"> WHY? </h2>
      <p>
        One of the main reasons why this position appeals to me is the salary. Salary is very important to me just like everyone else as this is will support my lifestyle and basic needs. How lavish or comfortable my lifestyle is depends on the salary that I make hence, this is an important factor of my ideal job. Another reason is that I have had 1 year experience in working as a L1 Network Engineer along with 3 years as an IT Service Desk/Remote Support Agent. Having had  plenty of IT experience, I’m familiar with this this sector and feel comfortable staying and progressing my career in this field.
      </p>
    <h2 class="ideal_job"> Experience, Skills & Qualifications </h2>
    <p>
      I currently hold a Diploma in Computer Engineering where I studied how to design network systems, configure network devices, troubleshoot on network connectivity issues and programming in Java and C++ amongst others. I also have knowledge of how operations work at a Network Operations Centre (NOC) while working as a L1 Network Engineer. The duties of a L1 Network Engineer include monitoring network devices, and actioning on any alert that comes up on our tool.  If required, we raise the incident tickets to level 2 network support or local service provider for further checking. For faulty hardware issues, we liaise with local IT for onsite assistance. On top of that, we take in requests to configure network device ports and raise the change requests for approval and implementation. Once approved, the implementation of configuring the devices will also be done by our team. Besides that, the job also exposed me to voice engineer duties as well since we were required to configure IP Phones for users which required utilizing Cisco Unified Communications Manager (CUCM) tool.
      <br><br>
      After working as a Network Engineer, I spent 3 years working as an IT Service Desk which also acts as Remote Support. This job required me to work and support end users remotely via calls, chat and remote session. As end user issues are varied, I met with a lot of different cases that requires me to be creative and resourceful to be able to resolve the issues in a timely manner.
      <br><br>
      The relevant work experience in the networking field I possess is only 1 year however, it was very insightful one as I got to have hands-on experience of what an entry level position in this field of work does. I also got to interact with my seniors on L2 Network Support and ask them about their jobs and duties. Being exposed to what the job entails as well as being able to talk to those further up in the same career path gave me a better understanding of the field. I am familiar with the duties of a Level 1 Network Engineer and have seen first-hand duties done by Level 2 support as well. This will be helpful in settling in as a Senior Network Engineer as I have a rough idea on what to expect. Also, although the 3 years spent in IT Service Desk/Remote Support is not completely related to networking, it’s also not completely irrelevant as I gained a lot of troubleshooting knowledge over the years which exercised my thinking flexibility and developed my people skills as well which is applicable to this ideal job as it requires me to liaise with different people such as clients that are requesting for network system designs as well as team members and others of higher position.
    </p>
    <h2 class="ideal_job"> Job Requirement & Plans </h2>
    <p>
      To build on the skills and experience I already have to be able to qualify for my ideal job stated above, first and foremost, I will need to obtain a Degree in Information Technology. Afterwards, I will need to apply for junior networking engineer roles first to build on top of my existing 1 year of network experience as a minimum of 5 years is required to undertake the role in the listing. By building on this, I will be able to familiarize myself with the scope of job position more and gain knowledge along the way. I will also be studying to obtain cisco network certifications such as the Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA), Cisco Certified Network Professional (CCNP) and Cisco Certified Internetwork Expert (CCIE). As networking and security evolves at a fast rate, I will need to continuously renew my certifications to ensure that my knowledge is up to date. By doing all of these, I will be able to gain the knowledge and expertise to be able to qualify for the job stated above.
