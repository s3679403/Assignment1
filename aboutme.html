    <p>Name: Kayla Viktoria Sabucdalao Gaytano
    <br>Student ID: S3679403
    <br>Student Email:  s3679403@student.rmit.edu.au</p>

    <p>My name is Kayla Viktoria. I am Filipino. I was born in Philippines, however, my family migrated to Singapore when I was 8 years old. So, I was raised and grew up here. I am fluent in English and conversational Tagalog. I also know a bit of Chinese from living here and constantly hearing the language around me.  Some of the things I enjoy doing are listening to music, reading, karaoke and binge watching movies and shows. I'm currently enrolled in Bachelor in Information Technology. Prior to enrolling in RMIT, I worked in the IT industry for about 4 years and before that, I obtained a Diploma in Computer Engineering in Singapore Polytechnic. One fun fact about me is that I was part of one of the primary school choirs  who represented Singapore in the 5th World Choir Games in 2008 held in Austria under the children’s choir category. My choir, Tampines Primary School Children’s Choir obtained a SILVER IX in the qualifying round. Although that meant we didn’t make it through to next round, it was a very enriching experience for a 12 year old especially since it was my first time travelling without my family with me.</p>
