    <h2 class="PP">Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Test: INFP-T</h2>
    <p>
      INFP-T stands for Introverted (I), Intuitive (N), Feeling (F), Prospecting (P) and Turbulent (T).
      <br><br>
      I  feel that the test result is fairly accurate for the most part and reveals a little bit about myself as a person and what I am like. I have taken this test before 2 years ago and the results are roughly the same. This tells me that over the years, my personality has not had any drastic changes. I will be detailing below on how the test results apply to me and the pros and cons of the traits presented.
      <br><br>
      As an introvert, although the test indicates that most introverts are reserved, this particular trait does not apply to me in smaller group setting as I do give my opinion when I think it’s needed not necessarily when it is asked. The situations in which I can be considered reserved would be when I’m part of a larger group of people. Nevertheless, I still possess the trait that introverts are more susceptible to their environment and able to read the mood and atmosphere which is useful in ensuring that in a team, everyone is getting along well. The con of being an introvert however, is that too much exposure to social situations can drain my energy which could affect my performance.
      <br><br>
      Intuitive individuals have overactive imaginations. As such this can be taken as a creative trait. I’m an open-minded person and a very inquisitive one at that. This is favorable in group project settings as there will be more exchange and gathering of information which will be helpful towards the progression of our work. However, because of the activeness of
      <br><br>
      Having the feeling trait means I’m prone to leading with my heart and emotions rather than my mind. This can be viewed in a positive light such that I’m compassionate, caring and considerate of others especially in a group setting. I will often make sure that everyone in the team has their opinions and concerns addressed or voiced at least to make sure that everyone has had a say. At the same time, the weakness to this trait would be due to the superfluous concern that I display towards others, I can become too involved and be easily affected by the emotions of the affected individuals.
      <br><br>
      As a prospecting individual, I’m able to handle unforeseen circumstances that can be seen as a hurdle in most cases.  I’m adaptable and constantly brainstorming ideas to come up with a better solution. This will showcase my creativity and boost productivity for the team and myself. The downside to this would be that I can be easily overw	helmed by the number of choices and can come off as indecisive which would delay the conclusion of whatever project I’m handling at the moment.

    <h2 class="PP">Learning Style: Auditory / Tactile</h2>
    <p>
      As an auditory learner, I learn best by listening. I do agree with the outcome of this test as the results describe me perfectly. I repeatedly find myself reading my notes out loud to be able to better comprehend and remember it. Furthermore, I am also a tactile learner hence I learn by doing, being active and hands-on with the task at hand. Using a combination of auditory and tactile learning styles will produce the most beneficial outcome for me in terms of understanding and retaining information.

    <h2 class="PP">Leadership Style: Front-line Leader</h2>
    <p>
      I believe the test results describe me accurately as I do consider myself genuine when interacting with my peers. Being able to  perceive their emotions, I can empathize and connect with others on  a deeper level. I love to share my experience and engage others to do the same. By doing this, I’m able to push others to work towards a common goal. This will be essential in a team to help forge closer bonds and deeper understanding of each other so we can align towards a shared vision.
