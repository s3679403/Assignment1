    <!-- overview of project idea -->
    <h2 class="idea">Overview</h2>
    <p>
      My IT project idea is to develop a phone application that will focus on resolving a few of the difficulties faced by those who utilizes a vehicle, specifically pertaining to parking. Two of the struggles faced by drivers and motorcyclists are finding an available lot in a parking space as well as locating their car or motorcycle in a big multi-storey carpark after doing their errands. This project aims to create a tool that is able to ease the frustration of having to drive around trying to look for a parking spot and walking around aimlessly after forgetting where the vehicle is parked. It will also provide them a choice in carpark by being able to see the list and rates of all the carpark in the vicinity of their chosen destination hence providing the users more options  to consider if they are concerned about their budget. This tool is marketed towards customers who frequent big establishments such as malls and airports that usually houses a spacious parking space for their patrons. With this implementation the time spent for vehicles drivers to find a lot and returning back to their vehicles will be significantly reduced. That function together with budget-friendly alternatives will result in better user satisfaction.

    <!-- motivation -->
    <h2 class="idea">Motivation</h2>
    <p>
      According to a survey conducted by Nissan, 33.75% of United Kingdom’s (UK) drivers are not able to remember the location of their parked cars in a one month time frame and furthermore, 5% of UK drivers have this recurrence nearly on a weekly basis.  This shows the numbers affected by this issue. Another research conducted in Netherlands by psychologists depicted the same problem where 115 shoppers participated in the survey, resulted in 14% of them made an indirect course to where their car is parked and 50% admitted to having forgotten where they parked their car regularly. This project intends to resolve the presented problem mentioned earlier to lower the time taken for drivers to find their cars and also provide additional service of being able view other choices on where to park their car in instances where there are not much vacant parking lots in their intended carpark and require alternatives or when they want lower cost options.
    </p>
    <!-- description -->
    <h2 class="idea">Description</h2>
    <p>
      The product will be available on mobile devices by download via the Google Play Store or the iPhone’s App Store. A phone app is most suited for this project as in this day and age, majority of people carry a smartphone with them more than carrying a wallet. Another reason for this is that many drivers tend to use their phones for GPS hence all the more reason for a phone app. It is also ideal as there are no other pre-requisites required for the establishment customers to be able to utilize this service besides the installation from the respective phone app store.
      <br><br>
      Different carpark lot availability, distance as well as the cost per hour will be visible in the app to assist the users in deciding where to head to for parking. This will be displayed in a simple layout for ease of usage. The main page of the app will display the list of carparks available. The users will be able to filter the list based on cost, distance and lot availability. There will also be a search function available where users can indicate the establishment they want to go to which will yield the list of carparks in the vicinity.
      <br><br>
      The users can select the specific carpark to be able to see a more detailed view of the carpark details such as price per hour, distance, address, nearby facilities as well as the number of lots available. By clicking the address of the carpark, the app will redirect the users to their own native mobile map app to guide the users via GPS which would assist the user with navigation to the destination carpark.
      <br><br>
      The detailed view of the carpark will also have a link on page that will load the map of the carpark for the users to see the positioning of the lot vacancies which is kept up to date with the help of sensors placed at every lot which will send information to the server to update the app in real time. This will also be the page where the users will be able to mark out their chosen parking space when they have parked their cars for them to refer to so that they can locate their cars with ease when they are ready to head out from the establishment. When the users are in the carpark, their live location can be seen in the app itself which will make it easier for them to plan their route to the vehicles.
      <br><br>
      The top left of the app will feature a left arrow button for when the users wants to return to the previous page. The bottom of screen will display the navigation bar which will consist of 3 icons. It will have the home icon to display the home page, a vehicle icon where the users can check on their marked parking space so they can check where their cars are parked and also a settings icon which will include the app details and support contact. Having the aforementioned features available for the users, will allow them to be able to make a more  cost-efficient decision and save money. This is also be useful in providing better alternatives for the users for situations where the parking lots are limited.
    </p>
    <!-- tools and technologies -->
    <h2 class="idea">Tools and Technologies</h2>
    <p>
      Software development tools such as XCode for iOS and Android Studio for Android phones are required for this project to develop the mobile app. As for the physical tools, Bluetooth chips and sensors will have to be installed at every lot of every parking space that is to be included in the app. Bluetooth technology will be used for the live tracking of the users to the parking lot while the sensors will be used to identify vacant lots. GitHub will also be used to store the files in the a repository. The hardware will consist of Bluetooth circuits, capacitors, resistors, diodes, integrated circuits and sensors which will be used in the creation of the device that will be attached on top of the each parking lot.  Lastly, the extensive list of parking lot locations, carpark layout diagrams as well the cost per hour of each carpark will have to be collated into a database to be incorporated into the app for the users to peruse through.
    </p>
    <!-- skills required -->
    <h2 class="idea">Skills Required</h2>
    <p>
      Programming skills is necessary for coding of the software. XCode software supports programming languages such as C++, C, Python and AppleScript amongst others. Android Studio on the other hand, supports C++ and Java to name a couple. Digital electronic knowledge will also be needed for creation of circuits and soldering of the components such as the sensors and Bluetooth chips onto  circuit boards. Knowing basic programming will not be enough to be able to produce this application as mobile app development is complicated and will require numerous testing and troubleshooting. However, there are multiple courses available online to develop this skill. One example of such resource is LinkedIn. LinkedIn provides online classes to assist with the advancement and honing of one’s skill. Similarly, there are courses available to learn about digital electronics which will introduce the world of digital circuitry and provide the knowledge of components of circuitry such as sensors, transistors and integrated circuit chips which will be used to develop the hardware for this project.
    </p>
    <!-- outcome -->
    <h2 class="idea">Outcome</h2>
    <p>
      The desired outcome of this project is for drivers and motorcyclists to be able to not only find a carpark that fits their criteria of a good carpark such as price, cost, distance and lot availability but to also assist them in locating their vehicle with lack of difficulty hence, cutting down the time it usually takes for them to get those done. With the time saved from finding carparks, lots and locating their vehicle, customers will be able to spend more time doing other important things like addressing their purpose for visiting the premises. They will also be able to leave the site just as quicky since they will be able to locate their vehicle much faster especially for those people that tend to forget the location their vehicle is parked. This will benefit not only the current user of the lot but also those who are searching for a parking space as the turnaround time of each lot will be faster.
