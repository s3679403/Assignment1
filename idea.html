      <h2 class="idea">Overview</h2>
      <p>
        My IT project idea is to develop a phone application that will address a few of the difficulties faced by those who utilizes a vehicle, specifically pertaining to parking. Two of the struggles faced by drivers and motorcyclists are finding an available lot in a parking space as well as locating their car or motorcycle in a big multi-storey carpark after doing their errands. I aim to create a tool to be able to ease the frustration of having to drive around trying to look for a parking spot and walking around aimlessly after forgetting where the vehicle is parked. This tool is marketed towards customers who frequent big establishments such as malls and airports that usually houses a spacious parking space for their patrons.

      <h2 class="idea">Motivation</h2>
      <p>
        TBD
      </p>

      <h2 class="idea">Description</h2>
      <p>
        The product will be available on mobile devices and downloadable via the Google Play Store or the iPhone’s App Store. A phone app is ideal for this because of its portability and also because most people will carry around a smartphone on a daily basis hence, there are no other pre-requisites required for the establishment customers to be able to utilize this service besides the installation from the respective phone app store. Different carpark lot availability, distance as well as the cost per hour will be visible in the app to assist the user in deciding where to head to for parking. Once the user has selected the carpark, the app will redirect the user to the native mobile map app to guide the user via GPS which would assist the user with navigation to the destination. When the user is at the location, the user can refer to the app once more to be able to see a map of the carpark  and check on the available parking lots with the help of sensors placed at every lot which will send information to the server to update the app in real time. From there, they can drive to their chosen parking space. When using the app, a live location of the user’s device can be seen on the in-app carpark map which will allow the user to navigate through the carpark to the chosen lot with ease. Once parked, the user can mark the vehicle location on the map itself so that he will be able to locate the car once he is ready to head out.
      </p>

      <h2 class="idea">Tools and Technologies</h2>
      <p>
        Software development tools such as XCode for iOS and Android Studio for Android phones are required for this project to develop the mobile app. As for the physical tools, Bluetooth chips and sensors will have to be installed at every lot of every parking space that is to be included in the app. Bluetooth technology will be used for the live tracking of the user to the parking lot while the sensors will be used to identify vacant lots. Lastly, the extensive list of parking lot locations, carpark layout diagrams as well the cost per hour of each carpark will have to be collated into a database to be incorporated into the app for the user to peruse through.
      </p>

      <h2 class="idea">Outcome</h2>
      <p>
        The desired outcome of this project is for drivers and motorcyclists to be able to not only find a carpark that fits their criteria of a good carpark such as price, cost, distance and lot availability but to also assist them in locating their vehicle with lack of difficulty hence, cutting down the time it usually takes for them to get those done. With the time saved from finding carparks, lots and locating their vehicle, customers will be able to spend more time doing other important things like addressing their purpose for visiting the premises. They will also be able to leave the site just as quicky since they will be able to locate their vehicle much faster especially for those people that tend to forget the location their vehicle is parked. This will benefit not only the current user of the lot but also those who are searching for a parking space as the turnaround time of each lot will be faster.
